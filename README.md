Hardware Requirements: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, Name of the Library: TensorFlow 2.15.0, Programming Language: Python.
The result file contains the model prediction results and experimental records.
By directly using the visualization script, the experimental results of the paper A Study on SIREN Wavefield Simulation Guided by  Frequency Progressive Curriculum can be reproduced.
My_CustomLayers.py: This script implements the custom layers dedicated to the SIREN;
loss_plot.py: This is a dedicated script used to visualize and plot the loss curves generated during model training;
prediction_plot.py: This is a visualization script used to visualize and present the generated prediction results(Must use the corresponding tf version);
Results folder: Results without curriculum learning;
T1Results folder: Results with curriculum learning.
